# Sustainable DarwinCore MIxS Interoperability

From the [charter](https://www.tdwg.org/community/gbwg/MIxS/):

> The Task Group has been convened to consolidate previous work that aimed to prevent siloed 
> (meta)data standards development in the omics and broader biodiversity communities. 
> The TG will leverage procedural and technical advancements in TDWG and the GSC to 
> develop a sustainably interoperable MIxS-driven extension of DwC. The result will 
> ensure that data produced in either MIxS- or DwC-compliant form can be automatically 
> brokered between user communities, bringing the communities closer together.
